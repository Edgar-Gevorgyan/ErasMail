ErasMail
===========

ErasMail is a free and open source tool that allows you to clean up your email boxes. The goal of ErasMail is to contribute to the reduction of digital pollution and more particularly of the pollution generated by emails. 

Most of the cleaning tools are limited to unsubscribing and deleting newsletters, not to mention the fact that they sell their users' data. Erasmail offers much more features and does not keep/sell any data. 

ErasMail uses IMAP which makes it compatible with all email providers.
